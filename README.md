Created with next.js, tailwindcss and scss

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional environment

-   I used feature branches and [pull requests](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/cryptus/pull/10)

## Why I worked on this project

-   Getting into the world of typescript made me realise I need to practice more on using typescript.
-   I also had the chance to use popular fetching library called [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

## Main Features

-   [Home page](https://cryptus-nine.vercel.app/) consist of relative data about coins, exchanges, nfts
-   [Coins page](https://cryptus-nine.vercel.app/cryptocurrencies) and [exchanges page](https://cryptus-nine.vercel.app/exchanges) lists out different coins and exhanges in which users can search for their favourite coin/exchange.
-   users can click on their favourite coin to check its history. e.g [BTC history](https://cryptus-nine.vercel.app/cryptocurrencies/1)
-   [nft page](https://cryptus-nine.vercel.app/nfts) and [news page](https://cryptus-nine.vercel.app/news) contains different nfts and crypto news respectively;

## How to navigate this project

-   The application fetches data from [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub).
-   All pages used can be found in the [pages folder](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/cryptus/tree/master/pages)
